## Group Contributions

Juan Zapien - He worked on debugging a lot of the code and making sure that all the functionality was working correctly. Juan also focused on implementing user accounts and also worked on the SQLite database set ups. Other code that Juan worked on along with everyone else was storing user data to the database and presenting it to the user that was logged in. Overall Juan worked on most of the code along with all other members.

Ellisa Lee - She worked on designing UI layouts from low-fidelity to high-fidelity screens. Along with layouts, she worked on choosing, designing, and creating UI components (such as color scheme, fonts, main home buttons, visuals) that fit the design of the app.  She implemented intro.js to give tutorials to the novice users. She also worked on creating database for regions page that has GET/POST functions during AJAX calls. Nonetheless, she worked most of the code collaboratively with her teammates.
	
Amparo Davalos - Her contributions to team's project involved working in several areas of it. Some of the main contributions included incorporating the data visualization and working with the databases from different parts of the web application. In addition, she worked on implementing the initial stages of some of the UI as well as working on different pieces of functionality code with the rest of the team members.

Ryan Chambers - His contributions centered around many pieces of the project, as all of the group memberes worked together for a majortiy of what was completed. He started with working on a high fidelity mock-up of the orginal app design. As work on the code started, his main contributions were in layout of the code files (i.e. how all of them would be organized and connected) as well as the javascript functionality for tracking the page time visits. He also spent time helping in design of the pages and formatting of the data storage and retrival.
