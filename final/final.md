## UI Improvements
We've improved the login page of our site by removing the Facebook login feature, which was not implemented, allowing the user to focus on creating an accunt through our registration process, which was also improved by replacing an email with a username, since emails are private information that we don't necessarily need. The homepage was improved by including a new hover over image feature that displays the category overlayed on the faded image. This cleans up the overall look and feel of the front page. The regions/conditions pages were improved by adding brain images to accompany the displayed topics, such as hindbrain or midbrain. The tracking page has been transformed from a basic HTML table to new C3 bar graphs to represent the data. Finally, the brain visualization page was implemented and a new API allows the user to explore a 3D model of the brain from this page. On each of the pages, the stand-in logo in the top left was replaced wth our site's name, and the profile button in the top right was replaced with a logout button, since all of the features previously available within the profile can now be accessed within the pages of the site, making this feauture redundant.

## Data Visualization
For our data visualization, we've decided to implement a set of bar charts to represent the total amount of time and the average amount of time spent by the user on each of the particular pages available on our site. This data visualization allows them to easily compare the amount of time they've spent studying for each of the representative topics and allows the user to ajust their habits accordingly. We chose this over something like a pie/donut chart because of the number of pages we have; a bar chart allows us to display information for every page without confusion.
