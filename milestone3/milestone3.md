### Comparison to Prototypes

	The rough draft of our skeleton is a combination of both of our initial
	prototypes. In the skeleton we included both a section for diseases and
	a section for different areas of the brain, whereas in the prototypes 
	these were two different ideas. The home page will be displaying an API 
	for a 3D brain model with which the user can interact with initially, 
	which we got from prototype 2. Then below this model will be two 
	buttons, the regions button and the conditions button inspired by 
	prototype 1 but modified to include the two bigger ideas (conditions 
	and regions). These two buttons will lead to new pages with the 
	different options to go to within that specific section. The purpose 
	for these two sections is to help users who may want to better 
	understand the effects of the disease in the brain. The regions section 
	is provided to provide a little more context into the brain functions 
	in order to better understand the effects of the illnesses. The new 
	pages for the two sections will contain pictures and labels as links to 
	the individual pages for each condition or brain region.
