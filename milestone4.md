## Statement regarding Privacy 
In an approach to addressing user privacy, my team has decided to limit the amount of data we collect from the user. Since we will be collecting data about the time a student spends on the app studying, we will only collect data about the user such as time they spend on a page, clicks on a certain page, and user information such as email 
and a password, which is needed to create an account. Before we collect any of the data, we will display the consent form to make sure the users know what data is being collected from them so they can decide if they want to use the app. We will also make it very clear that none of their information will be shared publicly. It will only be seen by them.
