Nothing much was improved on our home screen, just a few changes on the buttons and the forms' proportion on the page. 

## Home Screen

For our homescreen, we've added a new button called, 'Tracking', which will allow the users to keep track of their study hours on each sections/chapters while using the app. 

## Regions Screen (altogether in one page)

The regions screen had the most change on our overall UI skeleton. Firstly, breadcrumb and jumbotron features were added to make the contents to be more organized. Breadcrumb in the header shows the user, in which page he/she is in. The contents within the Jumbotron will work as a hero-content, where it grabs the user's attention by displaying the main regions in a bigger font and details in smaller fonts. There are four button laid out horizontally to inform the user what other parts of the regions could be shown. Due to this feature, our 'regions.html' was deleted, because it seemed redundant. The darker grey part, which is technically the body section, will have more detailed information about the corresponding region with visualizations. 

## Conditions Screen

Above is the example screen of one of the conditions page, where it will display the text and images that correspond to the condition. 

## Tracking Screen

As stated above in the home screen section, tracking screen was added to provide the user with visualization on their study hour/click/view status on each sections of the study material within the app. 

## Screens to be worked on

Above screens are the ones that need to be worked on in future. 

## Statement regarding Privacy 
In an approach to addressing user privacy, my team has decided to limit the amount of data we collect from the user. Since we will be collecting data about the time a student spends on the app studying, we will only collect data about the user such as time they spend on a page, clicks on a certain page, and user information such as email 
and a password, which is needed to create an account. Before we collect any of the data, we will display the consent form to make sure the users know what data is being collected from them so they can decide if they want to use the app. We will also make it very clear that none of their information will be shared publicly. It will only be seen by them.
