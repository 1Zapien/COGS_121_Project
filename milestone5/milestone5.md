Our login page had major changes, background image was added, login form was redesigned, app name was made (but our logo is temporary for now). But there are still 'get username' and 'get all' buttons at the bottom, which will be used for future user data references... once we feel confident, we will delete them. 
## Home Page

Our home page also had the major changes with the simple text button being changed to infographic buttons. We chose a color scheme, so the layout overall had changes in colors.  

## Regions/Conditions Page

Our conditions and regions page had some changes in regards to fonts, colors, but we are still looking for the best layout.
