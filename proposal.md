## Project Ideas

  ### Idea 1 (Job Search Information)
  
This app would look through job search datasets and find the skills that are most popular for each of the jobs. In terms of the user interface, when someone searches a job title, the app would show them the most popular skills (in the form of a graph or table). The app would make it easier for people to know what skills are required for the job they want, or, if they are searching for future jobs, they would know what skills they need to gain or improve on.

  ### Idea 2 (Brain Visualization)
  
This app would import data from brain scan datasets to determine various locations in the brain that are responsible for a set of brain diseases/conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, seizures, and strokes. The app would allow you to scroll through these various conditions and present visuals of highlighted brain locations responsible, or pictures representing how the conditions affect specific parts of the neuron. This could be used for educational, professional, or personal reasons. For example, a doctor could use this to explain such conditions to a patient and their family, or a student could use it to better understand a topic they are studying.
